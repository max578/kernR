# Hierarchical Kernel Causal Test

Extends bd-HSIC and DR-DATE/DR-DETT to hierarchical (nested/clustered)
data by decomposing the test statistic into within-cluster and
between-cluster components.

## Usage

``` r
hierarchical_test(
  y,
  treatment,
  covariates,
  cluster_id,
  method = c("dr-date", "dr-dett", "bd-hsic"),
  kernel_y = kernel_spec(),
  n_permutations = 500L,
  weight_method = c("equal", "icc", "within_only"),
  seed = NULL,
  verbose = FALSE,
  ...
)
```

## Arguments

- y:

  Numeric vector or matrix. Outcome.

- treatment:

  Treatment variable (binary for DR tests, any for bd-HSIC).

- covariates:

  Numeric matrix of confounders.

- cluster_id:

  Factor or integer vector identifying clusters.

- method:

  Character. `"dr-date"` (default), `"dr-dett"`, or `"bd-hsic"`.

- kernel_y:

  Kernel specification for outcomes.

- n_permutations:

  Integer. Number of permutations. Default is 500.

- weight_method:

  Character. How to weight within/between components: `"equal"`
  (default), `"icc"` (variance decomposition), or `"within_only"`.

- seed:

  Integer or `NULL`.

- verbose:

  Logical.

- ...:

  Additional arguments passed to the underlying test. Do not pass
  `cross_fit` or `n_folds`: within-cluster sub-tests are always fit
  in-sample, as the top-level within-cluster permutation supplies the
  calibration.

## Value

An object of class `"kernel_test_result"` with additional `hierarchical`
component containing within/between statistics.

## Details

For clustered data (e.g., patients within hospitals, plots within
farms), standard kernel tests may have inflated type I error because
observations within the same cluster are not independent.

This function decomposes the test into:

- **Within-cluster**: Average of within-cluster test statistics (tests
  for treatment effects within each cluster).

- **Between-cluster**: Test on cluster-level mean embeddings (tests for
  treatment effects across clusters).

The combined statistic is a weighted sum, with weights determined by
`weight_method`. Permutation is performed within clusters to preserve
the hierarchical structure.

## Examples

``` r
# \donttest{
set.seed(42)
n_clusters <- 20
n_per <- 30
n <- n_clusters * n_per
cluster_id <- rep(1:n_clusters, each = n_per)

# Cluster-level random effects
cluster_effect <- rnorm(n_clusters, sd = 1)[cluster_id]
x <- matrix(rnorm(n * 2), n, 2)
t <- rbinom(n, 1, plogis(0.3 * x[, 1]))
y <- 0.5 * t + cluster_effect + x[, 1] + rnorm(n)

result <- hierarchical_test(y, t, x, cluster_id,
  method = "dr-date",
  n_permutations = 100,
  seed = 1
)
print(result)
